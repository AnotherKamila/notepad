Welcome to My Pretty Notepad
============================

My notepad is the following 2.5 things:

* a [(multi)markdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)-based notepad
  written in PHP
  - it displays markdown files from inside the content/ subdirectory, generating
    the HTML as needed
  - currently contains only a viewer, but will have an editor some day, too
* a collection of public notes on things like algorithms and data structures,
  English grammar, biology and just about anything else (where the notes attempt
  to be somewhat useful to the outside world)
* the 0.5 of a thing: a coding excercise whereby a 17-years-old girl is
  attempting to learn PHP

I do not currently have hosting, but I am planning to get this thing online
soon.

What I think is cool about my notepad
-------------------------------------

* it has pretty URLs
  - a file located at `content/path/to/file.text` can be viewed at the URL `http://something.com/notepadroot/path/to/file`
* it has pretty CSS, too ^-^
  - maybe not in older browsers
  - maybe not in mobile browsers, to be tested
* [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) is cool everywhere, including in my notepad
