Welcome to My Pretty Notepad
============================

My notepad is the following 2.5 things:

* a [markdown][md]-based notepad
  written in [PHP](http://php.net/)
  - it displays markdown files from inside the content/ subdirectory, generating
    the HTML as needed (and caching into files, but this might be unnecessary --
    TODO)
    - does so thanks to the neat [PHP Markdown implementation][phpmd]
  - currently contains only a viewer, but will have an editor some day, too
* a collection of public notes on things like algorithms and data
  structures, English grammar, biology and just about anything else
  (where the notes attempt to be somewhat useful to the outside world)
* the 0.5 of a thing: a coding excercise whereby a 17-years-old girl is
  attempting to learn PHP

What I think is cool about my notepad
-------------------------------------

* it has pretty URLs
  - a file located at `content/path/to/file.text` can be viewed at the URL `http://something.com/notepadroot/path/to/file`
* it has pretty CSS, too ^\_^
  - maybe not in older browsers
  - maybe not in mobile browsers, to be tested
* [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) is cool everywhere, including in my notepad
* the same thing about coolness holds for [Markdown][md]

I do not currently have hosting, but I am planning to get this thing online
soon.
